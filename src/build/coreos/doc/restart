Usage: pandahook build coreos restart -h HOOK-TYPE  -n REPOSITORY -s SERVICE [-s SERVICE]
-------------------------------------------------------
Follow any command with "help" for more information.

The CoreOS module's "restart" produces a script that destroys and restarts services
on the CoreOS cluster. One or more services may be specified after naming the target git
repository.

Required:
  -h  Hook-Type.  This name informs git when to activate the githook after it
        has been placed into the hook-server. It is also the file-name of the
        generated script. The generated file is placed into the working directory.

        Allowed Values:
        "applypatch-msg", "pre-applypatch", "post-applypatch", "pre-commit",
        "prepare-commit-msg", "commit-msg", "commit-msg", "post-commit",
        "pre-rebase", "post-checkout", "post-merge", "pre-push", "pre-receive",
        "update", "post-receive", "post-update", "pre-auto-gc", "post-rewrite"

  -n  Remote Repository Name.

  -s  Service Name. Services are specified by name only (without the .service
        suffix).  Template service files must include the "@" suffix.  At least
        one service must be specified.  Additional services may be specified by
        using additional "-s" flags.

        Example Service Designations
        ----------------------------------
        test    => test.service
        test@02 => test@02.service
